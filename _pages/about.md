**Research:** I am an EECS PhD student advised by [Shinichi Nakajima](https://web.ml.tu-berlin.de/author/dr.-shinichi-nakajima/) in the Machine Learning Group of [Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jplQac8AAAAJ&hl=en). My current focus is on developing advanced techniques for diffusion models to solve general inverse problems, particularly using guidance mechanisms, conditioning, and projection methods. I am also investigating universal joint source-channel coding using self-supervised neural networks, with particular interest in their scalability and the underlying scaling laws. 

**Previously:**
Before joining BIFOLD, I was actively involved in 6G research at the [Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz Institute](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/), focusing on neural joint source-channel coding and signal separation problems.

I earned my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from TU Berlin, where I collaborated with [Peter Jung](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/peter.jung/) and contributed to the field of compressive sensing leveraging priors from deep generative models.
